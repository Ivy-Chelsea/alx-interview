# [0-validate_utf8.py](./0-validate_utf8)
A cript that attemps to solve the following challenge:
~ Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

~ Prototype: def validUTF8(data)<br>
~ Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False<br>
~ A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long<br>
~ The data set can contain multiple characters<br>
~ The data will be represented by a list of integers<br>
~ Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer
