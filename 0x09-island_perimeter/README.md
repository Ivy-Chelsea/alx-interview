# [0-island_perimeter.py](./0-island_perimeter.py)

~ A python script that attempts to solve the following puzzle:<br>
~ Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

~ grid is a list of list of integers:<br>
~ 0 represents water<br>
~ 1 represents land<br>
~ Each cell is square, with a side length of 1<br>
~ Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).<br>
~ grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100<br>
~ The grid is completely surrounded by water<br>
~ There is only one island (or nothing).<br>
~ The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
