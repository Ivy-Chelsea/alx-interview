A script that attempts to solve the following challenge:

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

~ Prototype: def minOperations(n)<br>
~ Returns an integer<br>
~ If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
